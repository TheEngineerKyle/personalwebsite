				This is a side-project of my own that had begun when my back and legs ached sitting long hours leading
				me on an internet search to see if an adjustable standing desk that tilts existed. To my surprise, there
				were no such product on the market, so I designed one myself in SolidWorks with manufacturability and
				affordability a priority. I created a desk that can go from a height of 44 inches down to 27 and go from
				being level to 6 or 12 degrees of tilt. One rotation of the handle adjusts the height a finely tunable
				3/8 inch. Inside both legs of the desk are miter gears translating the torque from the crank handle to
				helical screws. The threads of the helical screw create the lifting force to raise the desk by pushing
				against female threads anchored in the leg bases.</p>

				<h3>Cantilever Trellis Pergola</h3>
			</header>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pergola/body.jpg" alt="" /></span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				Following the completion of my uncle's outdoor kitchen him and I build, we agreed something was needed
				to protect it from the elements while being aesthetically pleasing. Not wanting to overwhelm the patio
				with a traditional 4-post pergola, I proposed a cantilevered trellis structure that admirably accents
				his Tudor home. This cantilever pergola maintains an open feeling yet provides a sense of intimacy and
				privacy where it&#39;s needed. Several engineering solutions were incorporated to facilitate the
				cantilever,
				thereby keeping the patio free from vertical support posts while maintaining a safe stucture for years
				to come. Construction of this project is planned to begin in spring 23'.

					<h3>Aluminum Pump Housing Deformation</h3>
					<p>
						This ANSYS simulation involved a thermal stress analysis on a pump housing. The housing had a
						fixed support on its bottom mating surface and frictionless supports on the surrounding
						countersink holes. The exterior surface was exposed to convention of 20°C. The inner surface was
						set to a constant 90°C while the bottom mating surface was set to a constant 60°C. The greatest
						equivalent stress occurred at the frictionless countersink holes while the greatest deformation
						occurred near the top exit hole. The factor of safety for the aluminum pump housing was a
						maximum of 15 and a minimum of 0.47 indicating the part needed further optimization.

					<h3>Determination of Drag from CFD Analysis</h3>
					<p>
						This computational fluid dynamics analysis determined the drag coefficient of a Porsche GT2 RS
						model imported from SolidWorks. The car model and flow region were meshed and resulted in a 0.34
						drag coefficient—accurate to what Porsche reports for this performance car. The figure
						illustrates the velocity streamlines around the car with aerodynamic flow separation at the
						trailing edge of the car and the boundary layer formed over the body.

					<h3>Non-linear Contact of O-Ring Seal</h3>
					<p>
						This simulation analyzed the capability of an O-ring gasket to seal a vacuum chamber. The
						material assignments were given, and the mesh was adjusted accordingly. Supports were given to
						the groove and a downward displacement was assigned to the top plate. The simulation showed the
						O-ring deforms such that it conformed to make a full contact on the side walls of the grooved
						region demonstrating it was adequate in maintaining a seal.

					<h3>Spur Gear Stress Analysis</h3>
					<p>
						This study examined the interaction between a gear and pinion system designed, mated and
						assembly in SolidWorks and imported to ANYSIS. The gears were given a fine mesh with a
						concentration on the edges where the teeth make contact for increased stress accuracy. The
						findings showed the FoS was a mere 0.28 concluding the system needs to be further refined to
						increase reliability (i.e., enlarging gear size, reducing gear load, stronger gear material).

					<h3>Shrink Fit of Two Cylinders</h3>
					<p>
						This simulation aimed to show the tangential stress, deformation and contact pressure for two
						cylinders under a shrink fit constraint. The process involved creating two separate geometries
						within each another and defining the contact surfaces of the outer and inner cylinders. A
						pressure of 30,000 PSI was assigned to the inside surface of the inner cylinder. The largest
						percent error was under 1.5% percent--showing the accuracy and precision of simulation tools.

					<h3>Thermal Analysis of Microchip Assembly</h3>
					<p>
						This simulation analyzed temperature exposure on a microchip assembly consisting of a copper
						base plate and connectors and porcelain. The microchip produced 25 W of heat that dissipated
						through the assembly then expelled to an ambient air of 25°C. Results showed a maximum
						temperature of 177°C occurring at the assembly region colored in red and a minimum 86°C at the
						far end of the base plate. Furthermore, the middle connector had an average temperature of
						160°C.

					<h2>About me</h2>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/kyle/1.jpg" alt="" /></span> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
					&nbsp; &nbsp;
					I'm a drafting engineer, specializing in residential design renovations. I graduated with a Bachelor
					of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. &nbsp; While in
					school I took part in several internships and gathered industry experience in product development,
					product compliance, quality assurance, and website development (I created this site!). &nbsp;
					I&#39;m a
					skilled communicator having taken on multiple leadership roles in teams of up to 28 individuals from
					diverse backgrounds. I have superior analytical and problem-solving skills and the ability to
					identify the root cause of issues and implement creative, targeted solutions. I&#39;m
					performance-driven
					while valuing my mental well-being usually by means of staying fit.</p>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/kyle/2.jpg" alt="" /></span> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
					&nbsp; &nbsp; Running has always been my outlet helping me process and reframe many areas of stress
					in my life (that&#39;s me at the NYC Marathon start line in 2019). When it comes time to unwind, I
					like
					to sit my feet up and strum my acoustic guitar but even more gratifying to me, is being an uncle to
					my two Nieces and two Nephews. &nbsp;&nbsp; Fiona, Kiera, Tristan, and William have vitalized my
					life more than I ever would've imagined, and I can&#39;t wait to see them grow up. My journey has
					not
					been easy balancing school and work, but it truly has been rewarding as I have learned many valuable
					lessons along the way. </p>
